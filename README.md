I'm a **SWE** from the Eastern US who is relatively experienced building with TypeScript and its associated ecosystem.
I'm also into trailrunning with my dog.

Currently working on (primarily the frontend of) [@pico-mes](https://github.com/pico-mes) to help midsize factories do more with their data.
