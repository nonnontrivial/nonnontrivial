## about me

Digital plumber with â‰ˆ 9 years of experience in web engineering (incl. significant TypeScript React experience and working knowledge of Golang, Python, Kotlin, Android, Docker/Podman, Bash, and Linux).

I tend to work on frontend-related projects in small teams.

I'm passionate about incrementally improving my development workflow and contributing to opensource software.

Personally, I'm an avid reader in my spare time, with interests ranging from classical CS topics to Theology.
