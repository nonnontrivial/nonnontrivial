### Hi, I'm Kevin Donahue

I'm a **software engineer** from the Eastern US. I worked on open source projects in the Node.js, Next.js, and React ecosystems, and am currently interested in:

- image processing
- data visualization
- systems engineering

I'm an **autodidact** in the fields of programming, philosophy, and theology.
