Hi, i'm Kevin, digital plumber with â‰ˆ 7 years of professional experience in software.

Containerized Python, scripting with Lua and Bash, React.js for the web, and Kotlin for Android across protocols like HTTP, MQTT, and gRPC, all in small-ish teams with care towards how it winds up in front of users, whether at the edge, on a tactical network, or as part of SaaS.

> I studied art in school but pivoted to computer science after realizing that audio engineering was an optimization problem.

### i've worked on

- [sky brightness application](https://github.com/nonnontrivial/ctts) to infer sky brightness at H3 cells using a custom model (python, h3, pytorch, docker, rabbitmq)
- tools to enhance situational awareness for defense (kotlin, python, podman, XMPP, postgres)
- frontends of digraph-based tools for manufacturing execution and conversation design (react, redux, typescript, gRPC)

- measuring night sky brightness
- vim golf
- kettlebell
