Hi, i'm Kevin, digital plumber with â‰ˆ 7 years of professional experience in software.

React.js for the web, Kotlin for Android, and containerized Python and Go across protocols like HTTP, MQTT, and gRPC, all in small-ish teams with care towards how it winds up in front of users, whether at the edge, on a tactical network, or as part of SaaS.

### i've worked on

- sky brightness model/api server/queue producer for generating sky brightness predictions over discretized earth surface over time (python, h3, pytorch, docker)
- graph-based UI tools for manufacturing execution and conversation design (react, nodejs, typescript)


### i'm interested in

- measuring & recording the night sky
- command line interfaces that are intuitive to use
- trail running
