Hi, i'm Kevin, digital plumber with â‰ˆ 7 years of professional experience in software.

Containerized Python, Bash, React.js for the web, and Kotlin for Android across protocols like HTTP, MQTT, and gRPC, all in small-ish teams with care towards how it winds up in front of users, whether at the edge, on a tactical network, or as part of SaaS.

> I studied art in school but pivoted to computer science after realizing that audio engineering was an optimization problem.

### i've worked on

- [sky brightness application](https://github.com/nonnontrivial/ctts) for generating sky brightness predictions over discretized earth surface over time (python, h3, pytorch, docker, rabbitmq, gRPC, postgres)
- applications for enhancing situational awareness in a defense setting (kotlin, python, podman, XMPP, postgres)
- frontends of digraph-based tools for manufacturing execution and conversation design (react, redux, typescript, gRPC)


### i'm interested in

- measuring night sky brightness
- learning the math that i didn't in school
- kettlebell
